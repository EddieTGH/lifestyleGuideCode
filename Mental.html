            <h6 id="p111">
            Mental health refers to a person’s emotional, psychological and social well-being. It impacts how one thinks, feels and acts. Our mental health affects how we handle stress, relate to one another and make decisions. Mental health influences the way individuals look at themselves, their lives and others in their lives. Like physical health, mental health is important at every stage of life. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, in a given year, one in five, or 18.5% of American adults will experience a mental illness. Some of the most common and frequently reported mental illnesses include depression and bipolar disorders, anxiety, schizophrenia, dementia, and eating disorders. Depression is the number one cause of disability worldwide and is one of the most significant contributors to the global burden of disease, greatly impacting individuals and their families mentally, physically, socially, and financially. Mental illness affects everyone no matter their race, gender, culture, age, ethnicity, or sexual orientation.

        <h3 id = "h222">Why is It Important?<h3> <!--Second paragraph-->
        <h6 id="p222">All aspects of our lives are affected by our mental health, and protecting our mental health is as critical to our daily lives and our independence. Mental and physical health are equally important components of overall health.  Mental illness, especially depression, increases the risk for many types of physical health problems, particularly long-lasting conditions like stroke, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. Similarly, the presence of chronic conditions can increase the risk for mental illness. It is also very beneficial because it can give you a positive image about yourself and everything around you.  You should always be aware of the state of your mental health because it can affect every aspect about you. This is why it’s important to stay mentally healthy.

                Be aware of what others are going through. Reaching out if you think you or someone you know needs help can make all the difference.  S If you, or someone you know is in a crisis, please call the 24/7 suicide prevention hotline; 1-800-273-TALK (8255). They can help those dealing with substance abuse, economic worries, relationship and family problems, sexual orientation, illness, getting over abuse, depression, mental and physical illness, or loneliness. For mental illnesses, you should consult a doctor and don’t be afraid to. Don’t discriminate. Anyone can have mental health problems even if they are a child. Like adults, children and adolescents can have mental health disorders that interfere with the way they think, feel and act. When untreated, mental health disorders can lead to school failure, family conflicts, drug abuse, violence and even suicide. Untreated mental health disorders are often very costly to families, communities and the health care system. Don’t ever doubt how someone is feeling. It’s better to believe them.

            <h6 id="p444">
                Surround yourself by trusted loved ones, live well with diet and exercise, and maintain activities that you enjoy to better ensure positive mental health. You alway have people to talk to who care for you. Don’t ever feel that you are alone. Also, mental illnesses are more common than you think, and you should embrace them. Especially during this time when you can’t see people as often as you would, try to stay in touch with them. Try to stay positive as well. Don’t let your flaws bring you down. Embrace them and improve them.

        <h5 id="headings">Get Plenty of Sleep</h5>     
        <h6 id="paras">
            Sleep is really important for our physical and mental health. Sleep helps to regulate the chemicals in our brain that transmit information. These chemicals are important in managing our moods and emotions. If we don't get enough sleep, we can start to feel depressed or anxious.
        </h6>
        <h5 id="headings">Eat Well</h5>     
        <h6 id="paras">
            Eating well isn't just important for our bodies, but it's also important for our minds. Certain mineral deficiencies, such as iron and vitamin B12 deficiencies, can give us a low mood. Try to eat a balanced diet. If you find you're a particularly stressed or anxious person, you should try limiting or cutting out caffeine as this can make you feel jittery and anxious.
 
        </h6>
        <h5 id="headings">Avoid Alcohol, Smoking and Drugs
        </h5>     
        <h6 id="paras">
            Drinking and smoking aren't things which we always associate with withdrawal symptoms, but they can cause some which impact on your mental health. When you've had a few drinks you can feel more depressed and anxious the next day, and it can be harder to concentrate. Excessive drinking for prolonged periods can leave you with a thiamine deficiency. Thiamine is important for our brain function and a deficiency can lead to severe memory problems, motor (coordination) problems, confusion and eye problems.  If you smoke, between cigarettes your body and brain go into withdrawal which makes you irritable and anxious.
            Other drugs will often leave you in withdrawal and can often cause very low moods and anxiety. More severe effects of drugs include paranoia and delusions. There is some research that suggests drug use is related to developing mental disorders like schizophrenia.        </h6>
        <h5 id="headings">Get Plenty of Sunlight
        </h5>     
        <h6 id="paras">
            Sunlight is a great source of vitamin D. Vitamin D is a really important vitamin for our bodies and our brains. It helps our brains to release chemicals which improve our mood, like endorphins and serotonin. Try to go out in the sun when you can, but make sure you keep your skin and eyes safe. 30 minutes to two hours a day of sunlight is ideal. During the winter, some people become depressed because they aren't getting enough sunlight - this is known as Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). Some people find using a special light-therapy lamp helps to alleviate the symptoms. 
        </h6>
        <h5 id="headings">Manage Stress
        </h5>     
        <h6 id="paras">
            Stress is often unavoidable, but knowing what triggers your stress and knowing how to cope is key in maintaining good mental health. Try to manage your responsibilities and worries by making a list or a schedule of when you can resolve each issue. Often if you break down your worries and stresses and write them down, you realise that they are manageable. Try to avoid burying your head in the sand, and tackle problems face on. If you find you are having trouble sleeping, or are waking up thinking about all of the things that are stressing you out, write them down and reassure yourself that you can deal with them in the morning.
 
        </h6>
        <h5 id="headings">Activity and Exercise
        </h5>     
        <h6 id="paras">
            Activity and exercise are essential in maintaining good mental health. Being active not only gives you a sense of achievement, but it boosts the chemicals in your brain that help put you in a good mood. Exercising can help eliminate low mood, anxiety, stress and feeling tired and lazy. It is also linked to living a longer life.
 
            You don't need to run a marathon or play 90 minutes of football; a short walk or some another gentle activity might do the trick.        </h6>
        <h5 id="headings">Do Something You Enjoy
        </h5>     
        <h6 id="paras">
            Try to make time for doing the fun things you enjoy. If you like going for a walk, painting or a specific TV show, try to set aside time to enjoy yourself. If we don't spend any time doing things we enjoy, we can become irritable and unhappy.
 
        </h6>
        <h5 id="headings">Connect With Others and Be Sociable
        </h5>     
        <h6 id="paras">
            Make an effort to maintain good relationships and talk to people whenever you get the chance. Having friends is important not just for your self-esteem, but also for providing support when you're not feeling too great. Research has found that talking to others for just ten minutes can improve memory and test scores!
 
        </h6>
        <h5 id="headings">Do Things For Others
 
        </h5>     
        <h6 id="paras">
            Helping others isn't just good for the people you're helping; it's good for you too. Helping someone can help with your self-esteem and make you feel good about your place in the world. Feeling as though you're part of a community is a really important part of your mental health. You could try volunteering for a local charity, or just being neighbourly.
        </h6>
        <h5 id="headings">Ask For Help
        </h5>     
        <h6 id="paras">
            One of the most important ways to keep yourself mentally healthy is to recognise when you're not feeling good, and to know when to ask for help. There's no shame in asking someone for support if you're feeling low or stressed. Everyone goes through patches where they don't feel as good as they should. You can try speaking to your friends or family, or if you think your mental health is getting on top of you then you can speak to your GP.
