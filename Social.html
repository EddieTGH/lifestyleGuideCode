                <h4 id="Idescrip">Have you ever had that awkward moment of silence in a conversation? Have you ever
                    doubted your ability to make friends? Have you ever felt any insecurities, fears, or shynesses?
                    You've come to the right place. This isn’t another one of those shallow guides that tell you to “be
                    yourself”, “be more confident”, or “not overthink”. This is a guide written by someone who is
                    learning more and more everyday and who desperately wants to help you out.

                    I’m writing this specifically for you who blank out in social settings and don’t know what to say,
                    especially around new people.

                    Here’s how to socialize:
                    </h2>
                    <h5 id="idef">What is Socializing?</h5>
                    <h5 id="definition"><strong>Socializing</strong> is the action or practice of participating in
                        social activities or mixing socially with others. <br> <strong>Socializing</strong> can
                        also mean the action or process of causing a person to behave in a way that is acceptable to
                        their society.
                        <br>
                        <strong>Socialization</strong> involves being with and a part of other people; enjoying their
                        company, confiding in them or letting them confide in you, and working together towards shared
                        goals.
                        <p>Being sociable is a very beneficial skill to learn, and it should be something that's made a priority. You can learn to become a more social person – if you want to.

Generally extroverts will have less trouble getting out and talking to new people, but that’s to be expected. Don’t think, however, that outgoing people don’t make mistakes either. There are ways to make life easier while you’re out and about.</p>
                    </h5>
                    <h4 id="vidIntro"><br>Don't Be Afraid! </h3>
                        <h5 id="vidIntro2"> <br> <br> <br> Many people struggle to socialize with others, and many
                            people are afraid or hesitant to do so. 7 percent of the American population is even
                            affected with Social Anxiety Disorder. You are not alone.
                            The video on the right provides a practical example.</p>
                            For many men, Don Draper is the epitome of confidence. What most people don’t realize is
                            that confidence actually comes in two flavors. There is the external confidence that you
                            project, which can make closing deals, making friends or seducing happen more naturally.
                            There is also the internal confidence you feel which is how comfortable you are in any given
                            situation.
                            <p>In this video, we’re going to analyze what Don can teach us about both levels of confidence,
                            and how mastering each level can take you from being nervous to completely confident in any
                            situation.
                            Through its 4
                            lessons, this video is sure to teach you something. Watch it now!</p></h5>

                <p>Like it or not we have all been awkward at different points in our lives. Sometimes that awkwardness
                    gets in the way of connecting with other people or even feeling confident in ourselves. Awkwardness
                    doesn’t need to be the end of the line. In fact, if you handle yourself well you can turn
                    awkwardness (whether it’s just a moment or a way of being) into confidence. Which is what we are
                    covering in this video featuring Tom Holland. <!--Video Description-->

                    we cover extroverted celebrities, who charm in larger, obvious ways. What’s amazing about Keanu
                    (aside from the fact that he’s 54 and looks 34) is that he is massively popular in spite of his

                <h5><strong>Implement lifestyle changes to buoy your overall mood</strong></h5>
                <p>Making positive lifestyle changes can combat depression and anxiety. I cover them here:</p>

                        Improve Mood</a>
                <p>

                <p>You don't have to put all of the recommendations into effect, since different suggestions fit best
                    for different people, but generally the more the better.</p>
                <p><em><strong>Difficulty: Moderate</em></p></strong>
                <p>Some lifestyle changes are relatively simple to make, but others, such as exercising more often can
                    take more groundwork to get going.</p>

                </strong>
                <p>This step is a bit different in that it's not a specific task you can go out and do. It's more a set
                    of approaches you learn, which you can then use when counterproductive thoughts pop up as you're
                    working on your other social goals. For example, if you walk by a co-worker and they don't say hi,
                    you can use what you've learned to deal with a thought you may have such as, "She thinks I'm a total
                    loser".</p>
                <p>As I mention in the articles that cover this information, dissecting your thoughts alone won't cure
                    all your problems, but dealing with them constructively is better than taking them at face value and
                    giving them free rein to negatively impact your mood and behavior.</p>
                <strong>
                    <p><em>Difficulty: Easy</em></p>
                </strong>
                <p>I say this step is easy in the sense that you just have to sit down and analyze your thoughts.
                    However, it can sometimes be tricky to break them down. It also takes a while to get to the point
                    where you make self-defeating statements a lot less than you used to (you'll never be able to stop
                    doing it entirely, despite what some self-help books may imply).</p>
                <strong>
                    <h5>Read up on approaches for handling anxiety</h5>
                </strong>
                <p>A lot of people struggle with anxiety, in general, and around specific social situations. This
                    section has articles that cover various strategies for dealing with it. Some of them involve
                    switching your attitude (e.g., getting to a place where you don't care if someone sees that you're
                    nervous), while others are technique based (e.g., learning to breathe in a calming way). As I've
                    covered, some of the other tasks in this article help anxiety as well (mood boosting lifestyle
                    changes, learning to debate worrisome thoughts).</p>
                <strong>
                    <p><em>Difficulty: Moderate to Hard</em></p>
                </strong>
                <p>Many people who experience anxiety can significantly reduce it. However, it takes time to get good at
                    implementing the relevant strategies. </p>
                <strong>
                    <h5>Identify your obvious and more subtle social fears </h5>
                </strong>
                <p>If you have a problem with them then you're well aware of what your main social fears are. I'd also
                    encourage you to think about any more subtle ones you have, that may be influencing your choices and
                    behavior without you noticing. These smaller fears can be tricky to identify, especially if you've
                    been going through life on autopilot and haven't considered them until now. One way to root out
                    smaller fears is to think about any social situations you logically know you should be involved
                    with, but which you never seem to get around to taking part in. Also, sometimes we feel like we
                    don't like certain things, when we're really just intimidated by them.</p>
                <strong><em>
                        <p>Difficulty: Easy</p>
                    </em></strong>
                <h5><strong>Slowly start facing the social situations that make you uncomfortable</strong></h5>
                <p>Some people may want to tackle smaller fears first to build up some positive momentum. Other readers
                    may want to start with their bigger and most annoying fears, to get it over with. How to put
                    together a plan to gradually and systematically face your social fears is covered in this article:

                <p>You'll likely have to adjust your fear facing plan on the fly once you begin.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Difficulty: Moderate to Very Hard</em></strong></p>
                <p>Although it's worth it in the end, facing your fears, especially if they cause significant symptoms
                    of anxiety, can be quite difficult. I don't want to sugarcoat it. You may never fully eliminate a
                    fear either, but hopefully you can get to a point where it no longer interferes with the kind of
                    social relationships you'd like to have.</p>

                <h4>Article #2: The Main Tasks For Developing Your Conversational Ability</h4>
                <h5><strong>Identify the aspects of conversation you want to work on</strong></h5>
                <p>It's okay if all you can think of at first is, "I dunno... uh... I just want to get better at talking
                    to people". You can still go out and practice with a vaguer goal like that. You don't need to break
                    things down into a thousand smaller ones. However, it's also helpful if you have something more
                    specific you want to work on. Some examples may be:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Making more natural small talk</li>
                    <li>Approaching and talking to people you don't know at social events</li>
                    <li>Talking to a certain type of person</li>
                    <li>Doing better in specific types of conversation, such as big groups, or when people are joking
                        around.</li>
                    <li>Having more intimate, revealing conversations</li>
                </ol>
                <strong>
                    <p><em>Difficulty: Easy</em></p>
                </strong>
                <p>Once you've come up with some goals, you may want to order them by how difficult they seem, and start
                    with the easier ones. If that's not your style, you could begin with whichever one is the most
                    important to you to improve.</p>
                <h5><strong>Figure out if any of your conversation trouble spots are due to anxiety or
                        insecurities</strong></h5>
                <p>Some issues with making conversation are more technical, because a person has trouble thinking of
                    relevant things to say, or isn't the best at applying certain principles. It's also common for
                    people to be held back in this area by their fears and insecurities. For example, someone may want
                    to strike up a conversation with a classmate, but be too nervous to do it. </p>
                <p>If that's the case for you, you should check out the site's section <a
                        href="https://www.succeedsocially.com/articlesmoods" target="_blank">devoted to those
                        challenges</a>. You can work on your conversation goals in tandem with tackling your fears and
                    insecurities around to talking to people.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Difficulty: Easy</em></strong></p>
                <p>It should be simple to figure out the areas where your fears and lack of confidence are the problem.
                    Actually dealing with those issues will be more work.</p>
                <h5><strong>Figure out if any of your conversation problems are influenced by negative social habits or
                        attitudes you have, and then try to correct them</strong></h5>
                <p>This is another point that may send you off to another of the site's sections. Your social skills are
                    largely demonstrated through your conversation. That means any number of bad social habits or
                    attitudes can have a negative impact on the way you interact with people. The site's section on <a
                        href="https://www.succeedsocially.com/articlesoverallpackage" target="_blank">generally
                        improving your social persona</a> may help you here.</p>
                <p>It's generally more difficult to identify your bad habits. Some are easy enough to guess, but others
                    take longer to dawn on us.</p>
                <p>
                    <stron><em>Difficulty: Moderate to Hard</em></stron>
                </p>
                <h5><strong>Look into the site's writing on becoming a more well-rounded, interesting person</strong>
                </h5>
                <p>One more thing that affects your conversations is how much you've got going on as an individual. All
                    else being held constant, someone with a boring life and few real interests is going to have less to
                    offer in a conversation than someone who's experienced a lot. Again, the site's section on improving
                    your social persona has articles that cover this issue.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Difficulty: Moderate</em></strong></p>
                <p>It's worth it to improve yourself as a person even if it never helps your conversations. It is an
                    ongoing process though.</p>
                <h5><strong>Identify and follow up on opportunities to practice in the ways that will help you meet your
                        conversation goals</strong></h5>
                <p>With the preliminary points out of the way, this is going to be the main thing you're going to work
                    on. It's all about piling up that real world experience. The more the better. This <a
                        href="https://www.succeedsocially.com/practiceconversation" target="_blank">article</a> suggests
                    many of the situations you can put yourself in to get that practice you need.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>If your goals are about talking to people you don't know, and getting better at those first few
                        minutes of chit-chat, you'll want to find situations where you have to converse with a lot of
                        new people (e.g., chatting to people in public, a job in customer service).</li>
                    <li>If you more want to work on the later stages of conversation, you'll you need to look for
                        situations where you'll interact with the same people over and over (e.g., at a volunteer
                        position with several co-workers).</li>
                    <li>If you want to practice making conversation in a specific situation, obviously you have to seek
                        it out (e.g., talking to people in night clubs).</li>
                    <li>Similarly, if you want to get better at interacting with a certain kind of person, you also have
                        to find them (e.g., a guy who wants to get used talking to other guys could join an all-male
                        softball team).</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong><em>Difficulty: Moderate to Hard</em></strong></p>
                <p>It will take a good amount of time to develop your conversation skills, and you'll likely have a
                    harder time learning parts of it than others.</p>
                <h5><strong>As you become more comfortable, practice conversation in higher-stakes situations</strong>
                </h5>
                <p>It's unfeasible to control your interactions completely, but as much as possible when you're starting
                    out I'd suggest sticking to people you know are going to be friendly, supportive, and
                    non-threatening, such as co-workers or outgoing store clerks. As you begin to feel more proficient
                    and confident, start expanding your boundaries. Experiment with new ways of interacting with people,
                    like revealing your sense of humor or somewhat controversial opinions. Move towards the areas you
                    have more trouble with, such as self-disclosure. Experiment with talking to people who are more
                    intimidating, in situations you find more awkward (e.g., approaching someone attractive at a party).
                </p>
                <p><strong><em>Difficulty: Moderate to Hard</em></strong></p>
                <p>Hopefully the experience you've already attained in the previous steps will make these tasks more
                    possible.</p>

                <h4>Article #3: The Main Tasks For Creating A Social Life</h4>
                <p>Out of the main social problem areas this site covers, building a social life lends itself most
                    easily to creating a To Do list of specific tasks. There are clear behavioral steps to making more
                    friends, and the end goal is tangible and measurable. We usually have a good sense of whether our
                    social life is where we want it to be, both in terms of the quality and quantity of our
                    relationships. Compare this to a much vaguer goal such as 'feeling more confident'.</p>
                <p>Naturally, you'll want to skip the items you already have handled, or which don't apply to you. This
                    list isn't exhaustive either. If you think up a task which would also help you build your social
                    life, there's nothing stopping you from doing it. I've very roughly graded each task on how
                    difficult it is, so you can ease yourself into them slowly if you'd prefer,</p>
                <h5><strong>Spend some time researching your community, so you'll have a sense of places where you could
                        meet people, or invite people to hang out if you organize a plan.</strong></h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>What are some of the good coffee shops, restaurants, bars, and clubs in the area?</li>
                    <li>Where could you see a movie or concert?</li>
                    <li>Where could you play sports or do something outdoorsy?</li>
                    <li>What kinds of classes or lessons are available to sign up for?</li>
                    <li>What types of annual events come through town?</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Although I'm presenting this as a one-time task, it never hurts to periodically refresh your
                    knowledge of your town or city. There's always more to find out about.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Difficulty: Easy</em></strong></p>
                <p>With this step and the next, resist any urges to be overly picky when evaluating options. Some people
                    have a tendency to declare there's nothing good where they live.</p>
                <h5><strong>Think of all the ways you could potentially meet new people</strong></h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>Could you sign up for that drawing class you've always been interested in?</li>
                    <li>Could you make an effort to drop by your friend's poker game that he's always talking about?
                    </li>
                    <li>Could you join a casual sports league?</li>
                    <li>Could you volunteer somewhere?</li>
                    <li>Could you drop by some events from <a href="https://www.succeedsocially.com/meetup"

                <p><strong><em>Difficulty: Easy to Moderate</em></strong></p>
                <p>This task may be harder if...:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>...you have some generally anxiety around trying to meet new people - You may want to refer to
                        the site's section that covers fears and anxiety. This article on <a
                            href="https://www.succeedsocially.com/makingplansworries" target="_blank">worries people
                            have about making friends</a> may also be helpful.</li>
                    <li>...a specific option you want to pursue makes you particularly nervous (e.g., the idea of going
                        to a party and starting conversations with people makes you feel tense). Again, you may want to
                        check out the site's advice on dealing with fears and nervousness. You could also try an easier
                        method for meeting friends for now.</li>
                    <li>...it will be hard to free up time to pursue new interests. This is a case where you have to
                        decide where your priorities lie.</li>
                    <li>...you're feeling particularly stuck in a rut, and can't imagine trying anything new.</li>
                </ol>
                <h5><strong>Approach potential friends and talk to them</strong></h5>
                <p>In some situations, like meeting your friend's friends, this step will be almost automatic. In others
                    you'll have to take the initiative to strike up a conversation.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Difficulty: Moderate to Hard</strong></em></p>
                <p>This step can be tricky for a lot of reasons, such as shyness, weaker conversational ability, and
                    general social traits and habits that get in the way of your connecting to people.</p>
                <p>One way to make this step more manageable is to focus on the types of people you have an easier time
                    talking to and conversing with. It's also important to realize that no matter what you do, you won't
                    get along with everyone.</p>
                <h5><strong>Get potential friend's contact information</strong></h5>
                <p>This could be their phone number, email address, or Facebook user name.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Difficulty: Easy to Moderate</em></strong></p>
                <p>Some people feel a little uncomfortable asking someone for this information, since they fear
                    rejection.</p>
                <h5><strong>If you're going to naturally see your potential friends again, continue talking to them and
                        getting to know them when you cross paths</strong></h5>
                <p>For example, you may see a new co-worker again on future shifts, or continue to hang out with a
                    friend's friend on group outings.</p>
                <p><em><strong>Difficulty: Moderate</strong></em></p>
                <h5><strong>If appropriate, keep in touch with potential friends so the 'lead' doesn't go stale</strong>
                </h5>
                <p>This one varies. Some potential friends you'll see often enough that you don't need to text them or
                    talk to them on Facebook. Similarly, if you've met someone once and seemed to get along, sometimes
                    you'll follow up and invite them out fairly quickly. However, in some cases you'll need to keep on
                    their radar by staying in touch.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Difficulty: Easy to Moderate</em></strong></p>
                <p>Once again, some people fear rejection here, or worry they're bugging the other person with their
                    unwanted contact.</p>
                <h5><strong>Think of something you could do with potential friends</strong></h5>
                <p>Whether you're likely going to see someone again automatically, or whether your initial meeting with
                    them could be your last unless you follow up, it's important to invite potential friends to hang
                    out. First you have to think of some things you could do with them. This isn't a step you need to
                    overthink. Standard choices like grabbing some drinks, spending time with a group of other people,
                    going for a bike ride, or seeing a movie are often fine.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Difficulty: Easy</em></strong></p>
                <p>If you're not sure what you could do with someone, check out this article:</p>
                <a href="https://www.succeedsocially.com/activities" target="_blank">Things To Do With People</a>
                <h5><strong>Invite your potential friends to do something with you</strong></h5>
                <p>This could be a one-on-one outing, or a group event where you pull together a bunch of prospects at
                    once, or you hang out with some existing friends and one person you'd like to get to know better.
                </p>
                <p><strong><em>Difficulty: Easy to Moderate</em></strong></p>
                <p>Again, some people fear rejection here. They may also not know how to invite someone out. They may
                    also stumble while trying to put a plan together.</p>
                <p>There's also the matter of how well things will go once you're actually hanging out with them. Here
                    things like conversational ability, your personality, and your ability to connect with others will
                    come into play.</p>
                <h5><strong>If your potential friend doesn't accept your plan, but doesn't clearly state they're not
                        interested, try again later</strong></h5>
                <p>This is ambiguous territory. The person could not be interested in knowing you better, or they could
                    have just been busy, or what you suggested wasn't their style. It never hurts to try again a few
                    more times. Where you stand will usually become clearer with more information. If it later turns out
                    the person doesn't want to be friends with you, continue to try to meet new people. It can't pan out
                    with everyone.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Difficulty: Easy to Moderate</em></strong></p>
                <p>Some people are uncomfortable following up in the face of apparent rejection.</p>
                <h5><strong>When you've met someone you get along with, and have successfully hung out with them,
                        continue to keep in touch and invite them to do things with you</strong></h5>
                <p>This is the part where you actually grow the friendship. Again, some relationships may fizzle out for
                    various reasons. It's unavoidable.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Difficulty: Easy to Moderate</em></strong></p>
                <p>Some friendships grow easily. In others people continue to deal with their insecurities and fears of
                    rejection (e.g., even the ninth time inviting someone to hang out, they worry about being turned
                    down). Some people also have trouble getting to know others on a deeper level.</p>
                <h5><strong>Continue meeting new people, and trying to be friends with them until you're happy with
                        where your social life stands</strong></h5>
                <p>This involves repeating many of the steps above as necessary.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Difficulty: Easy to Moderate</em></strong></p>
                <p>I find this stage varies in how it goes. Some people get on a roll and have an easier time making
                    even more friends, once they've established that base of confidence and the assuredness that comes
                    from knowing you already have some kind of social life. Other people slow down once they've got some
                    friendships going. In some cases it's because they're satisfied with the small social life they've
                    built. For others they may actually be happier if they continued to get out there, but they've got
                    just enough going on that they get lazy and complacent.</p>
                <h5><strong>As you become more comfortable in your social life, try experimenting and pushing your
                        boundaries</strong></h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>Try making friends with people you're interested in, but feel more uncomfortable around.</li>
                    <li>Try out ways of meeting people that previously made you nervous.</li>
                    <li>Try taking on more of a central organizer role, and seeing what opportunities come of that
                        (e.g., putting together a recreational soccer team, throwing a big party for all your friends,
                        arranging a big trip to a restaurant at work).</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong><em>Difficulty: Moderate</em></strong></p>
                <p>These steps are more advanced, however they're not too bad, especially if you've already built up
                    some experience in making friends.</p>
